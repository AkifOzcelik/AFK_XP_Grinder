# AFK XP Grinder

This code will keep pressing random keys on your keyboard to prevent you from getting kicked out of the game.

## Configuration

- **`keys`**: Determines which keys you want to press. Add different keys to change this however you want.
- **`exit_key`**: Determines which key you want to press to stop the script. (You may need to spam it to stop the script effectively.)

## How to Use

### The .exe File

1. Run the .exe as admin. Ignore any warnings from your antivirus (if anything comes up), or the program may not work. (It has the same code as `v2.py`.)
2. Make sure you are in the game window.
3. To stop the script, long-press the `J` key.
4. And you are done!

### The .py File

1. You can run the script in any IDE that supports Python (Notepad++, VSC, PyCharm, etc.).
2. Make sure you have the `keyboard` library installed. If not, open CMD and type: `pip install keyboard`
3. Run the code and you are ready to go!
