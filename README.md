# AFK XP Grinder

This code will keep pressing random keys on your keyboard to prevent you from getting kicked out of the game.

## Configuration

- `keys`: Determines which keys you want to press. Add different keys to change it however you want.

- `exit_key`: Determines which key you want to press to stop the script. (I dont know why but you have to spam it.)

## How to Use

### The .exe File

1. Run the .exe as admin. Ignore the antivirus or the program won't work. (It has the same code as xpgrindgobrrr.py)

2. Make sure you are in the game window.

3. To stop the script spam the `J` key

4. And you are done!

### The .py File

1. You can run the script in any IDE that supports Python. (Notepad++, VSC, PyCharm etc.)

2. Make sure you have the `keyboard` library installed. If not, go in CMD and type in `pip install keyboard`

3. Make sure you are in the game window.

4.  And you are done!

## AFK Information

At first I've coded this script for only Fortnite. But then I decided to make it universal for every game.
